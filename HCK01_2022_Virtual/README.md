# Welcome to the web page for the 1st Get Your Brain Straight Hackathon !

The **Get Your Brain Straight** hackathons bring together neuroimage data
generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute
infrastructure providers for a hand-on, collaborative event. This community
collaboration aims to create reproducible, open source resources that enable
discovery of the structure and function of brains.

There are three components to the hackathon.
First, each hackathon targets the generation of a **Reproducible Resource** for registration and analysis of
a specific brain imaging modality.
**Tutorial** sessions share how to work with open source registration tools, open access datasets, or neurodata
archives.
**Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Breakout** sessions enable parties
interested in collaborating to come discuss and work on relevant topics.

## Logistics

- **Dates:** Monday, April 4th - Thursday, April 7th, 2022

  cost.
- Sign up for the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/brain_straight_hackathon_announcements).
- [Set up an account](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/computevisual.html) at the Brain Image Library (BIL).
- Optionally prepare a tutorial or organize a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) Breakout, described below.

# During the Hackathon

The week will start 8 AM Pacific Time, 11 AM Eastern Time, Monday, April 4th
in an introductory all-hands videoconference.

Following the introduction, join the tutorials, participate BoF breakouts, and
work on the Reproducible Resource Challenge.

On Thursday, 11 AM Pacific Time, 2 PM Eastern Time, participants will delegate one member to present their registration processing pipelines, results, and discuss lessons learned.

# Agenda

## Reproducible Resource Challenge: fMOST Mouse Brain Registration to CCFv3

## Tutorials

## Birds-of-a-Feather Breakouts

To lead or join a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) breakout session, create or join a
topic [in this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uthoU0CbY-sN5e4neY70IsHKPPXkR21fkcamMDJtmrg/edit#gid=0).
During the BoF, find the leader by clicking on their name in the [Image.sc Island Gather.Town](https://j.mp/imagesc-island) and moving towards their avatar with the keyboard arrow keys. When you are close to their avatar in the virtual space, you will be able to see, hear, and talk to each other.

If notes are taken during the BoF, please add them to the [BoF breakouts
folder](./BoFBreakouts). We recommend [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for collaborative,
well-formatted notetaking.
