# Metadata Preservation for Brain Registration

## Instructors

- Matt McCormick (Kitware)
- Lydia Ng (Allen Institute for Brain Science)
- Dženan Zukić (Kitware)

## Tutorial Description

In this tutorial, we will explain why metadata preservation is important for brain image analysis,
explicitly identify the metadata required for registration, how the metadata can be preserved, and
how these techniques apply to the fMOST dataset studied in the hackathon.

Duration: 1.0 hours.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand why neuroimage registration metadata preservation is important for reproducible, scalable, and sustainable analysis. 
2. Identify the spatial image and transformation metadata required for provenance and future analysis.
3. Identify standard formats and software tools to store and work with this metadata.
4. Understand how this information was applied to the fMOST example dataset to address volumes stored in non-standard formats, with different brain orientations, and collected at varying resolutions.
