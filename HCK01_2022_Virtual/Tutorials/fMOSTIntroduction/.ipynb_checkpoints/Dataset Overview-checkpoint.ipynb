Following imaging of the entire block face, the top 1 µm of tissue is sliced off with a diamond knife, exposing the next face of the block for imaging. For the entire mouse brain, a 15–20 TB dataset containing about 10,000 coronal planes of 0.2–0.3 µm xy resolution and 1 µm z sampling rate is generated within 2 weeks.\n",
