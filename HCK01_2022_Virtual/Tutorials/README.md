# How to create a new tutorial

- Post questions about the tutorial idea and team on the [Get Your Brain Straight mailing list][mailing-list], our communication mechanism as of PW28.
- When you are ready, add a new entry in the list of **Tutorials** by creating a new `README.md` file in subfolder in `Tutorials` folder, and copying contents of [tutorial description template][tutorial-description-template] file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:

1. Open [tutorial description template][tutorial-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to [Tutorials](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/GetYourBrainStraight/tree/master/HCK01_2022_Virtual/Tutorials/) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourTutorialName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of tutorial template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's __title, instructors, tutorial description sections__
1. Add a link to your project to the [main tutorial list](../#tutorials-how-to-add-a-tutorial)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
